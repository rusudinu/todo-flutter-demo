# Flutter todo demo app

This is a simple todo demo app built with Flutter.

It demonstrates the following:

- creating a new Flutter project
- calling a function when a button is pressed
- calling an api to fetch, save and update data

⚠️ this may not follow the best practices, rather it is just a starting point built for ease of understanding.
